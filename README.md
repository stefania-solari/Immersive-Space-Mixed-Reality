First exploration of OpenXR library applyed on metaquest3 headset.
we span on the environment a random number of animated jellyfish interactable and we send via UDP a message to touchdesigner everytime we release the jellyfish.
we receive an event from touchdesigner via UDP too and we instantiate something (i'm thinking about)
